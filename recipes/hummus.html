    <h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A blender or robust herbs mixer</li>
        <li>10-15 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked Chickpeas without additives - 200g</li>
        <li>Tahini - 1-5 tablespoons, depends on your taste</li>
        <li>Fresh Lemon Juice - ~1/2 of lemon, depends on your taste</li>
        <li>Olive Oil - 2-3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Garlic - 1 small clove for me, do as you like</li>
        <li>Salt - not too much, can add more later</li>
        <li>Spices: Pepper, Chili, Cumin,... - be creative</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the tahini, garlic, salt, pepper and some juice of the lemon
            to the blender pot and blend it. The result should be of mayonnaise
            like consistency. You can add the spices now or later, as you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the chickpeas and add them to the tahini mix. If you want you can
            even keep some of the juice and use it to adjust the consistency of
            hummus. (If your chickpeas come with preservatives it's better
            to drain them and use water to adjust the consistency.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Add some olive oil and water (or some chickpea water) to the mixture and
            start to blend it. Start with little water and keep adding more, if the
            mixture is too thick to blend properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend until you are happy with the result. A long blend will lead to a
            finer texture. Aaand done :) <br>
            Put your tahini in a nice cup, decorate it with some olive oil and maybe
            some coriander and enjoy it with bread, veggie sticks or whatever your
            heart desires. 
        </li>
    </ol>
